# University of Washington Graduate School Disorientation Guide

We're hoping to release the first copy in Autum 2019.
Until then we've posted a table of contents so you can get a sense of what will be included.

The aim of this project is to provide concise and accurate information for graduate students at UW, especially relating to topics which official university and department resources overlook or intentionally disregard.
As a result, some sections of the document present information and commentary which is critical of academia, UW, Seattle, etc.
This is not intended to dissuade readers from from graduate studies, but rather to help paint a more accurate picture of the issues faced by grad students at UW.

This guide is inevitably missing many narratives and perspectives.
The absence of these narratives is not indented as a dismissal of their validity or existence, but rather is an artifact of the limited resources available to create and maintain such a document.
In particular, we acknowledge that this document was primarily compiled by PhD students in STEM fields, and that the much of the information presented here reflects that.
If you feel that you have perspectives or contributions that would benefit this project we welcome your contribution.
